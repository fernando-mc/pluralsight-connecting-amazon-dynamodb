# Course Scenario:

Globomantics for HR is designing a new survey-taking product to be used by the largest businesses in the world to collect real-time anonymous and informal feedback from employees.

Because the vast majority of responses come in through these systems in response to company announcements, and other ad-hoc requests to submit feedback they need to make sure that their system can scale up to support large numbers of responses while still maintaining excellent application performance. Weâ€™ll monitor this performance using Amazon CloudWatch.

Because of the sensitivity of the data, we will need to make sure that the access to view this data is fully-auditable using Amazon CloudTrail.
