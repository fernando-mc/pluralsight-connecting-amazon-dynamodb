# AWS CLI

This course relies on the AWS CLI version 1.
It should also be compatible with AWS CLI version 2. 

Instructions for installing the AWS CLI can be found here: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

# Python 3

You can download the most recent version of Python3 here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Boto3

Python 3 should come with pip - the Python package manager.

You can use pip to install boto3 with:

pip install boto3

If you don't want to install boto3 globally on your machine, 
I suggest using a Python 3 virtual environment:

1. Create the Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:

On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

3. Install boto3 

pip install boto3

# Node.js

You can install Node.js from:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

# AWS SDK for JavaScript

Node.js should come with npm, the Node Package Manager.

You can use npm to install the AWS SDK with:

npm install aws-sdk
